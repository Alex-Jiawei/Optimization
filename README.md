# National Park Optimization: A Route and Cost Optimization

#### University of Chicago - ADSP 32013 - Optimization and Simulation Methods for Analytics final project

##### Executive Summary:
This project aims to develop an optimized touring route across U.S. National Parks, focusing
on minimizing fuel costs through mathematical modeling and simulation. By integrating factors
like distances, fuel prices, and vehicle fuel economy, we propose a cost-effective solution for
travelers in recreational vehicles (RVs).
